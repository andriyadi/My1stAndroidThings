# My1stAndroidThings
My 1st attempt to explore development with Android Things, to read I2C BMP280 sensor and display the readings to OLED I2C display. To add more complexity to my learning process, I use Kotlin programming language.

## Schematics
The connection between Raspberry Pi 3, BMP/BME 280 sensor, and OLED display is following.

You don't have to use Sparkfun's BME280 or Seeed's OLED, any modules will do, as long as you connect the right pins.
